# legacy

Before discovering GitHub and Git, I completed several personal projects.
These projects may not be fun, but I’ve selected a few to showcase here.

**NOTICE**

To ensure each program works, I’ve applied some updates.
However, I’ve tried to keep the original code as unchanged as possible.
For each program, I will specify what I updated.
I’ve also applied code formatting to each one to make it more readable.

**Development date**

All this programs are developed around 08/2017 - 04/2018 during my college.
